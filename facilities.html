  <img src="images/facilityone.jpg" alt="thirty person classroom at orchard stables">
  <p><b><i>30 Person Classroom</i></b>
  <br>
  <span class="yellowtext">__________</span>
  <br><br>
  Our classroom seats approximately 30 people, and it is available to hire by
  the hour for equine talks and demos. Classroom hire includes tea, coffee, and
  biscuits for all attendees. If requested, bacon/sausage butties or a vegetarian
  alternative can be ordered in advance, and there is a chip shop and co-op
  in the village, just a short walk or drive away. The classroom is directly
  next to the arena and the lunge-pen if these are required at the same time.
  Previously we have had talks from Karl Greenwood on rider-confidence; Integravet
  on Chiropractic and Acupuncture treatment for animals; Donna Case BSc Hons on
  Equine Nutrition; Darren Unwin on Equine Iridology and many more.
  <br><br>
  The classroom can be hired from <span class="yellowtext">£15</span> per hour.</p>

  <img src="images/facilitytwo.jpg" alt="sand arena with showjumps set up">
  <p><b><i>20 x 40 Outdoor Arena</i></b>
  <br>
  <span class="yellowtext">__________</span>
  <br><br> Our 20m x 40m arena is the perfect environment to coach your horse.
  The arena has been surfaced with an all-weather surface which is
  leveled weekly to maintain it, enabling riders to enjoy this
  arena nearly all year round (though we do have alternatives if extreme weather
  doesn't permit use). We also have a full set of show jumps which are free to use
  for those keen jumpers. The area is fully CCTV-monitored and can also be floodlit
  when the light begins to fade. There is also a sound-system if you wish to
  ride to music.
  <br><br>
  The arena can be hired from <span class="yellowtext">£10</span> for non-liveries.</p>

  <img src="images/facilitythree.jpg" alt="bridles and saddles in tack room">
  <p><b><i>Secure Tack Room</i></b>
  <br>
  <span class="yellowtext">__________</span>
  <br><br>
  The tack room at Orchard Stables also combines as an office and a kitchen, with
  a kettle, fridge, tea, coffee, and biscuits (if you get there quick enough!).
  It is also the area where any notices go up on the board about clinics, vet
  or dentist visits, or anything else there is to share. In the tack room, we
  have a designated space for each horse's bridle and saddle,
  although there is also a large, dry storage barn with separate bays for each
  livery to store your feed, grooming kit, rugs, hats, boots and any other horsey
  bits you may have; as well as another bay for your hay bales and mucking out
  equipment.</p>

  <p><b><i>Post and Rail or Electric Fencing</i></b>
  <br>
  <span class="yellowtext">__________</span>
  <br><br>
  Orchard Stables offers all year round grazing, providing both winter and summer fields,
  which are situated on sandy soil, ensuring that the ground is bog-free.
  Individual fields are provided for each horse, although you can choose to have
  your own herd turned out together. Some fields come with automated water troughs,
  and for those without, large water containers are situated close to the fields for
  easy access. There is a choice of either post-and-rail fencing and electric, we
  will do our best to suit you and your horse's preference of fencing.</p>

  <img src="images/facilityseven.jpg" alt="inside of a stable with bedding">
  <p><b><i>Large Rubber Matted Stables</i></b>
  <br>
  <span class="yellowtext">__________</span>
  <br><br>
  We have 15 large rubber-matted stables situated around an expansive concrete
  courtyard, with plenty of space to groom, wash or tend to your horse, a space
  which is also available for those visiting for clinics or camping. In our stables,
  we use wood pellet bedding, which is both economic and easy to muck-out. This
  can be bought from the stables. Some stables have automated water, although the
  tap is just metres away from each stable. </p>

  <p><b><i>Collingham Horse Adventure Park</i></b>
  <br>
  <span class="yellowtext">__________</span>
  <br><br>
  Collingham Horse Adventure Park, also known as CHAPs, is the first
  adventure park of its kind. An adventure park for equines! The park is a
  place to bring your horse or pony and have some fun. Try out the roller
  coaster, log roll, tunnel of love, water flume, ghost train and loads more.
  There is an assortment of small cross country jumps and obstacles. A place
  for you and your horse to have a go at horse agility, trail, TREC, natural
  horsemanship or somewhere to just help bombproof your horse and help both
  of you gain confidence. Free for our liveries.
  <br><br>
  CHAPS can be hired for <span class="yellowtext">£15</span> per horse.
  <br>
  Or <span class="yellowtext">£10</span> per pony under 14hh.
  <br><br>
